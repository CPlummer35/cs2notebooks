    "## Recursion Introduction\n",
    "- an algorithm (or a function in a computer program) is recursive if it invokes itself to do part of its work\n",
    "- the process of solving a large problem by reducing it to one or more sub-problems which are identical in structure to the original problem and somewhat simpler to solve\n",
    "    - eventually sub-problems become so simple that they can be solved without further division\n",
    "- for a recursive approach to be successful, the recursive \"call to itself\" must be on a smaller problem than the one originally attempted\n",
    "- in general, recursive algorithm must have two parts:\n",
    "    1. **base case** - handles a simple input that has direct answer (stops recursion)\n",
    "    2. **general case** - recursive part that contains one or more recursive calls to the algorithm\n",
    "    \n",
    "## pros\n",
    "- makes it possible to solve complex problems with concise solutions that may directly map the recursive problem statement (Tower of Hanoii problem)\n",
    "- focus on base case and how to combine the sub-problems (process of delegating tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "## cons\n",
    "- not intuitive to understand and may not have a counterpart in everyday problem solving\n",
    "    - must adopt the attitude that sub-problems take care of themselves (taking a leap of faith)\n",
    "- typically less efficient compared to iterative counterparts\n",
    "    - lots of function calls have computational and memory overhead\n",
    "- must be able to understand how to read and write recursive functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-world example\n",
    "### example 1\n",
    "- a project manager divides a large project and delegates sub-tasks to many workers \n",
    "    - s/he simply uses the reports from each worker to submit a final report of completion\n",
    "    - assuming each sub-task is similar\n",
    "    \n",
    "### example 2\n",
    "- you're in the last row of a movie theater and want to know to the row number. How can you find out?"

    "- think of the smallest version of the problem and solve it and expand it to the larger\n",
    "- steps:\n",
    "    1. write a function header in a way that you can call it to solve the smallest problem\n",
    "    - call the function with the smallest problem case\n",
    "        - mark this as your base case in function implementation\n",
    "    - expand the function header to solve a generic larger problem if necessary\n",
    "        - add this as the general case \n",
